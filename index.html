        My name is Kyle Shipley, and I like to solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a startup or small business looking to increase profits,
        find your market, or just establish an online presence,
        <a href='mailto:kyle@shiplington.com'>I'd love to help you</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that <strong>good business is more than good
        technology</strong>. I will work with you to understand
        the challenges you face in creating, marketing, and
        profiting from your idea. Software accelerates success,
        but there is nothing more important than <strong>solving
        real problems for your customers</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend most of my time building web applications
        in Ruby on Rails, although you will sometimes find me
        on the iPad or Arduino. I am the creator of
        <a href='http://www.awesomecontroller.com/'>Awesome Controller</a>,
        winner of Startup Weekend Indy for Fall 2011.
